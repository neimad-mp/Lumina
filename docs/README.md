# Lumina documentation

> **Purpose.** The index of Lumina's documentation: what the project is, every document with a
> one-line summary, reading paths for four kinds of reader, and which document is the source of
> truth for which question. Start here (or on the visual [landing page](index.html)).
>
> **Audience.** Everyone: players, level designers, engine and tool developers, and AI agents
> starting a fresh session.
>
> **Source of truth.** The code — [`src/`](../src/), [`tools/`](../tools/),
> [`sandbox/`](../sandbox/), [`public/levels/`](../public/levels/) — and the three binding
> contracts, [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md),
> [`contracts/LEVEL_EDITOR.md`](contracts/LEVEL_EDITOR.md) and
> [`contracts/COMBAT.md`](contracts/COMBAT.md) (the ARPG combat, added 2026-09-28). Every document below was checked
> against the code on 2026-09-27; where a document and the code disagree, the code wins.
>
> **Related.** [Root README](../README.md) (features, controls, performance at a glance) ·
> [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) (short guidance for Claude Code) · [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md)

![Starfall Vale — the Three Sisters falls on Mount Lumen at 17:24, golden hour: terraced pixel-art meadows, cascading falls with spray, wooden bridges and the tilt-shift blur of a roof in the foreground; the location plate top left, the clock and the minimap top right](assets/screenshots/starfall-three-sisters-falls.jpg)

**Lumina** is an HD-2D game engine in the style of *Octopath Traveler II*, built on three.js r186
with plain JavaScript ES modules: pixel-art sprites and textures standing in a lit, shadowed,
tilt-shift-blurred 3D diorama, with a 24-hour lighting palette, weather, particles, god rays,
procedural effects and an Octopath-style UI. Textures, character sheets and props are generated
at runtime. Ashen Crypt adds a [hybrid soundtrack](design/levels/ashen-crypt-audio.md), with
prepared recordings and retained synthesized effects. Three front
ends share the engine: a demo **game** that plays `lumina-level` JSON files (seven shipped levels,
from the 28 × 22 hamlet Willowmere to the 128 × 128 Starfall Vale and town of Gildhaven, including **Cinderwatch Pass**,
the one level with real-time ARPG combat), a visual **level editor** with a live HD-2D preview, and
standalone **sandbox** pages that test one module each. There is no test
runner: a headless-Chrome **harness** (`npm run check`) is how changes are verified, and
`npm run typecheck` checks the JavaScript against its JSDoc types (`tsc`, no `.ts` files).

## Reading paths

### (a) I want to play

1. [user/GETTING_STARTED.md](user/GETTING_STARTED.md) — install, `npm run dev`, the URLs and
   `?level=` parameters, troubleshooting.
2. [user/PLAYING_THE_GAME.md](user/PLAYING_THE_GAME.md) — controls (keyboard and gamepad), the HUD
   and maps, talking, time and weather, photo mode, the levels, guided tours of Emberfall and
   Starfall Vale, and combat on Cinderwatch Pass.
3. [user/shortcuts.html](user/shortcuts.html) — a printable one-page cheat-sheet of every key.
4. Curious what you are looking at? [features/FEATURES.md](features/FEATURES.md) and the
   [landing page](index.html).

### (b) I want to build levels

1. [user/GETTING_STARTED.md](user/GETTING_STARTED.md) — run the dev server (the editor can save
   into the project only under `npm run dev`).
2. [user/LEVEL_EDITOR_GUIDE.md](user/LEVEL_EDITOR_GUIDE.md) — the editor manual, with a
   15-minute tutorial ("Thistledown").
3. [design/LEVEL_DESIGN_GUIDE.md](design/LEVEL_DESIGN_GUIDE.md) — rules learned the hard way: the
   camera looks north, cliffs vs steps, bridges, water, light budgets, density, regions.
4. [specs/OBJECT_CATALOG.md](specs/OBJECT_CATALOG.md) — every object type and field, dialogue
   syntax, villager actions and behaviours.
5. The shipped levels as worked examples: [Willowmere](design/levels/sample-hamlet.md) (small,
   scripted), [Brightwater Crossing](design/levels/brightwater-crossing.md) (built in the editor),
   [Emberfall](design/levels/emberfall.md) (the reference village),
   [Starfall Vale](design/levels/starfall-vale.md) (128 × 128, generated),
   [Gildhaven](design/levels/gildhaven.md) (a 128 × 128 town, generated),
   [Cinderwatch Pass](design/levels/cinderwatch-pass.md) (96 × 120, generated, combat),
   [Ashen Crypt](design/levels/ashen-crypt.md) (64 × 88, generated, first dark dungeon).
6. Writing levels by hand or with a script: [specs/LEVEL_FORMAT.md](specs/LEVEL_FORMAT.md) and
   [specs/LEVEL_STORAGE_API.md](specs/LEVEL_STORAGE_API.md).
7. The look you are designing for: [design/VISUAL_DESIGN.md](design/VISUAL_DESIGN.md).

### (c) I want to extend the engine, the game or the editor

1. [architecture/OVERVIEW.md](architecture/OVERVIEW.md) — programs, layering rules, the frame
   loop, shared uniforms, the level pipeline, where state lives. The same in pictures:
   [architecture/diagrams.html](architecture/diagrams.html).
2. [development/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](development/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md) and
   [development/CONVENTIONS.md](development/CONVENTIONS.md) — the daily loop, sandbox-first work,
   regression practice, code conventions and the JSDoc type check.
3. The area you are changing:
   - engine modules — [architecture/modules/README.md](architecture/modules/README.md) (index of
     `core`, `audio`, `render`, `pixel`, `sprite`, `fx`, `lighting`, `world`, `level`, `ui`);
   - rendering — [architecture/RENDER_PIPELINE.md](architecture/RENDER_PIPELINE.md);
   - the game — [architecture/GAME.md](architecture/GAME.md); its combat —
     [contracts/COMBAT.md](contracts/COMBAT.md) (binding) and [GAME.md §15](architecture/GAME.md#15-combat-combat-levels-only);
   - the editor — [architecture/EDITOR.md](architecture/EDITOR.md);
   - speed — [architecture/PERFORMANCE.md](architecture/PERFORMANCE.md).
4. [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md) — what is binding, and the additive rule for
   changing a contract ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md),
   [contracts/LEVEL_EDITOR.md](contracts/LEVEL_EDITOR.md), [contracts/COMBAT.md](contracts/COMBAT.md)).
5. [ai/TASK_PLAYBOOKS.md](ai/TASK_PLAYBOOKS.md) — step-by-step recipes (new object type, tile,
   particle preset, post effect, texture, character, NPC action, input action, UI component,
   editor tool, level field, generator, dependency upgrade, enemy kind, combat tuning…); they are
   just as useful to humans.
6. [development/TESTING_AND_VERIFICATION.md](development/TESTING_AND_VERIFICATION.md) and
   [specs/AUTOMATION_API.md](specs/AUTOMATION_API.md) — how to prove a change works.
7. Before you start: [ai/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](ai/KNOWN_ISSUES.md); for the *why*:
   [history/DECISIONS.md](history/DECISIONS.md).

### (d) I am an AI agent starting a fresh session

1. **[ai/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md](ai/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md) — read it first, completely.** It gives the
   16 golden rules (light count, shader warm-up, determinism, byte-stable levels, the big-level
   path, the type check, untrusted level names…), the repository map, the verification loop and a "where to find X" index.
2. [ai/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](ai/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) — the "most important gotchas" list at the top, then
   the section for your area.
3. [ai/TASK_PLAYBOOKS.md](ai/TASK_PLAYBOOKS.md) — the recipe for your task, if there is one.
4. The canonical reference for the area (see the [source-of-truth table](#which-document-is-the-source-of-truth-for-what)),
   then the code it names.
5. [specs/AUTOMATION_API.md](specs/AUTOMATION_API.md) — `window.__game`, `window.__editor`, the
   harness steps; [development/TESTING_AND_VERIFICATION.md](development/TESTING_AND_VERIFICATION.md)
   for the regression checks to run before you finish.
6. When you change behaviour, update the canonical doc and [ai/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](ai/KNOWN_ISSUES.md),
   then run `npm run docs:check`.

## Keeping the docs correct

- **Every document starts with a header block** — purpose, audience, source of truth (the code it
  describes), related docs. Keep it when you edit; give a new document one.
- **Link, don't duplicate.** Each topic has one canonical document (the table above); other
  documents summarise in a sentence and link to it.
- **Refer to code by relative path and symbol name**, never by line number
  (`[TileMap.js](../src/engine/world/TileMap.js)` `move`).
- **The code wins.** When a document and the code disagree, fix the document; if the document is
  a binding contract, change it only additively ([contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md)) and
  record the difference in [ai/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](ai/KNOWN_ISSUES.md#documentation-discrepancies).
- **Contracts have typed copies.** The level format, the combat interfaces, the tool interface and
  the automation hooks are also declared as types the code is checked against
  ([development/CONVENTIONS.md §3.1](development/CONVENTIONS.md#31-the-type-check)); those types
  follow the code. When a contract document and its types disagree, the types are usually right —
  check the code and fix the document.
- **Numbers carry their conditions** (build, machine, spot, time of day). Measurements from the
  build history live in [architecture/PERFORMANCE.md](architecture/PERFORMANCE.md) and
  [history/PROJECT_HISTORY.md](history/PROJECT_HISTORY.md); other documents quote them and link
  there.
- **HTML pages** ([index.html](index.html), [user/shortcuts.html](user/shortcuts.html),
  [architecture/diagrams.html](architecture/diagrams.html)) are self-contained (inline CSS and SVG,
  no external resources), follow the light / dark preference and must work from `file://` and from
  `/docs/` on the dev server. Check them with
  `npm run check -- --page=docs/<file>.html --query= --out=<name> --wait=1000 --fps=0` and read the
  screenshot.
