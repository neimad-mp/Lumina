# Starfall Vale — Where the Stars Come Home

The design document of **Starfall Vale**, the flagship 128 × 128 showcase level: a whole vale on the
night of the Starfall Festival — the market town of Hearthwick on the Silverrun, Mount Lumen with its
observatory and the three waterfalls of the Three Sisters, Goldenfield Farms, Lake Mirrormere and its
fishing hamlet, the Meadowlands with a travelling troupe, the autumn Emberwood with a hidden glade,
and the Old Quarry. It uses every tile type, every non-combat object type, villager action and
behaviour, critter kind and particle-area preset of the level format (except `rain` and `snow`,
which follow the camera and are driven by the weather). The combat-only types (`enemy`, `chest`,
`waystone`) are covered by [Cinderwatch Pass](cinderwatch-pass.md) instead, so Starfall stays a
peaceful level. It is **generated** by a deterministic, self-validating
script; this page documents what the script builds and how to change it.

| **Audience** | Designers and AI agents extending or testing the big level; anyone writing a level generator. |
| **Source of truth** | [`tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs`](../../../tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs) (the generator — edit this), [`public/levels/starfall-vale.json`](../../../public/levels/starfall-vale.json) (its output — never hand-edit) |
| **Related docs** | [Level design guide](../LEVEL_DESIGN_GUIDE.md) (most of its rules come from this level's reviews) · [Performance](../../architecture/PERFORMANCE.md) (big-level batching) · [Level format](../../specs/LEVEL_FORMAT.md) · [Project history](../../history/PROJECT_HISTORY.md) · other levels: [Emberfall](emberfall.md), [Brightwater Crossing](brightwater-crossing.md), [Willowmere](sample-hamlet.md), [Cinderwatch Pass](cinderwatch-pass.md) (the combat demo) |

```bash
node tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs              # regenerate (≈ 0.8 s); refuses to write if a check fails
node tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs --out=<file> # write elsewhere (e.g. a scratch copy)
node tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs --ascii      # also print the tile map (still writes the level)
node tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs --quiet      # no report (errors still go to stderr)
node tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs --force      # write a failing level for inspection (exit code stays 1)
```

The run is deterministic: `--out=<scratch file>` produces a file byte-identical to the shipped
`public/levels/starfall-vale.json` (checked while writing this page).

Play it: `index.html?level=starfall-vale` (`&autostart=1` skips the title). Edit (view) it:
`editor.html?open=starfall-vale`.

## Concept and story

*Once a year the sky over the vale lets go of a few stars. Long ago a whole river of them fell into
Lake Mirrormere; they did not burn out. They sleep on the lakebed, and every Starfall a few of them
wake and glimmer up through the water to answer the sky.*

The traveller arrives at golden hour (17:24) on the King's Road at the south edge, on the evening of
the Starfall Festival. The villagers' dialogue forms loose chains that lead around the whole vale:

- **The main thread:** Mayor Aldous (Hearthwick) → Master Casimir, the Stargazer at the observatory
  on Mount Lumen → Grandmother Isolde at the fishing hamlet → the end of the **Long Pier** after dusk,
  where the sleeping stars rise.
- **Side threads:** Wendel sends you up to the Old Quarry; Dunstan points out the upland stair to the
  terrace; Old Gorse the switchbacks; Warden Ivo the stair down to the North Shore; Ansel and Signor
  Orsino the hermit's standing stones in the Emberwood glade; Tamsin Bloom the troupe camp south of the
  river; Garrick and Dunstan trade messages about a mended pickaxe.

Every direction a villager or signpost gives matches the geography (checked by the reviewers and, for
the signposted walks, by the generator's route checks).

*The world map (N / Tab). North is up; the player arrow is in Hearthwick Square.*

| Area | Rough extent (x × z) | Ground | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Hearthwick** (market town) | 43–88 × 38–80 | plain, level 2 (y 1.0) | the square (cobbles 62–77 × 51–64, well at (70, 57.5)), the Starlight Inn, Town Hall, Chapel of the Fallen Stars, bakery, smithy with an open forge, 3 stalls, 3 bridges over the Silverrun |

**The Silverrun** rises from a spring in the northern ridge (a rill at level 16 falling into the
spring pool), crosses the plateau as a fast stream, drops over the **Three Sisters** — high (62, 20),
middle (58, 28), low (60, 36) — into the pool at the foot of the mountain, runs south through
Hearthwick (x 57–59), then turns east along the town's south edge (tiles `e`) into Lake Mirrormere.
The **Mirror Falls** (113, 40) drop from Amberpine Heights into the lake's north lobe.

### Roads, stairs and crossings

The generator draws **43 named paths** as polylines with widths — cobbles (`c`) in Hearthwick
(the King's Road through town is 3 wide, x 69–71), dirt (`.`) outside: the King's Road south to the
spawn and north over the mountain, Lantern Lane, the Quay walk, the River walk, the West Road to
Goldenfield, the East Road to the lake, the shore paths, the Heron trail, the Emberwood and glade
trails, the plateau walks and the quarry road.

## Special mechanics

### The Starfall night event

After dusk the sleeping stars glimmer up through the lake off the end of the Long Pier. It is built
entirely from level data — no code:

| Object | Where | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `emitter_20` (fireflies) | (104.5, 66.5), box 10 × 0.8 × 8, 44 particles, `dy` 0.3 (centred 0.3 above the lakebed, just under the 0.4 surface; the box reaches 0.7) | rising lights, recoloured `#a8d8ff` → `#fff4c8` through `params` |
| `emitter_21` (fireflies) | (101, 58.8), box 6 × 0.8 × 4, 18 | the same by the North Pier |
| `light_5` | (104.2, 66.6), 0.9 up | a blue (`#9ec9ff`) night-only glow on the water (intensity 9, distance 9, flicker 0.4) |
| `light_4` + `emitter_17` (sparkle) | the island (111, 71) | the island's own glow — "that glow is the stars' own" |

The `fireflies` preset only shows at night (`nightVisibility` 1), so the lights fade in as the night
factor rises through dusk. The level starts at 17.4; at the game's clock speed (one game hour ≈ 90 s)
full night (21.4 h) arrives about six minutes later, or press **T** until "Night". Casimir, Isolde,
Ivo, Quentin and the town-hall notice all point at it.

### Rest, shops and music

- **Rest** — Marigold at the Starlight Inn: her own choice page ends the dialogue, so any answer but
  the first ("Rest until morning") fades out, sets the clock to 8:00 and shows "You feel well rested."
  Her line warns that you will sleep through the stars.
- **Shops** — Barnaby (Starlight Bun), Quentin (Paper Lantern), Nell (Moonpetal Tea), Tamsin
  (Starbloom Garland), Orsino (Festival Ribbon). Each "yes" adds the item to the session inventory
  (`game.inventory`, keyed by the lower-cased item name) with a chime and "Obtained: …". Items have no
  further use; the dialogue describes what villagers do with them rather than giving instructions.
- **Music** — Lark starts the music if it is off; while it plays he offers "Keep playing / Some
  quiet" (the second stops it).

### Night lighting

95 light descriptors share the 12 pooled lights: every 0.2 s they go to the lamps nearest the camera
focus whose range touches the view (+1.5 units per priority step), crossfading as you walk. The
busiest square has 20+ lamps within 12 units, so a few of them are always dark. The review's
verifier found every lamp within 9 units of the player lit at 10 night spots (the art reviewer's
272-spot sweep: 5 unlit lamps within 9 units in total, down from 114 before `priorityWeight` went
from 4 to 1.5). The square's well lanterns and the Wishing Oak's lanterns were added because those
spots were dark.

## Particle areas

42 areas, using every non-weather preset (`dust`, `fireflies`, `mist`, `sparkle`, `leaves`, `smoke`,
`petals`, `embers`):

| Preset | Count | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fireflies | 12 | the millrace, the farm pond, the lake (the star lights ×2, the South Beach, Reedmouth), the meadow pond and meadows, the Wishing Oak's crown, the glade, the Emberwood pond and woods |
| sparkle | 10 | the pools below the falls, the spring, the Mirror Falls stream, the observatory lens, the glade stones, the island and the lake |
| leaves | 5 | the orchard, three in the Emberwood, Amberpine Heights |
| mist | 5 | the foot of the Sisters, the spring, the Mirror Falls |
| petals | 4 | the Meadowlands (×2), the glade, the square |
| dust | 3 | the square, the farm fields, the quarry |
| smoke | 2 | the hamlet's fish-smoking rack, the woodcutter's camp |
| embers | 1 | the troupe's campfire |

On this big level, areas whose box is more than 34 units from the camera focus are switched off.

## Environment settings

| Field | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timeOfDay` | 17.4 | golden hour, a little later than Emberfall's 17.2 |
| `camera` | distance 30, pitch 32 (no bounds: automatic from the walkable area) | |
| `highGround` | `{ minY: 4.2, pitch: 40 }` | tilt down on the terrace, plateau and highland |
| `title` | "STARFALL VALE", "Where the Stars Come Home", "Press any key", credit "A Lumina HD-2D showcase · three.js" | |
| `titleCamera` | x 97, z 62, y 0.6, drift 5 × 3, distance 42 | the hamlet, the piers and the calm lake under the title |
| `fogScale` | 0.65 | thinner haze: dawn and dusk otherwise dissolved the far layers into one salmon fog |
| `scenery.southGap` | 10 | open meadow south of the map, so the outer woods don't stand between the camera and the spawn |
| `forest.areas` | 7 world rects | tree kinds of the border and outer woods: autumn Emberwood, pines on Amberpine Heights and Mount Lumen, oaks and birches round the farms, the lake and the meadows |
| `godRayAreas` | 5 | Hearthwick (6 shafts), the Emberwood (6), the plateau (4, y 7.5), Amberpine Heights (3, y 4.5), the Meadowlands (3) |
| `foliage` | seed 2024; 6 flower areas, 5 shrub areas | blue-white glade flowers, mixed meadow flowers, yellow farm flowers, blue lakeside flowers; bushy Emberwood and highland |

## How it was made

Starfall Vale was built in phase 4 of the project (see [PROJECT_HISTORY](../../history/PROJECT_HISTORY.md)):
a scalability engineer made big levels affordable (`LightPool`, spatial batching and culling,
shadow proxies, the collider grid, the shore worker, the minimap and world map) while a level designer
wrote the generator; an integration and art pass followed; four reviewers (explorer, art, perf, data)
filed 50 findings, all fixed, and a verifier toured the result with real input.

The generator ([`tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs`](../../../tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs), ~2400 lines)
runs these steps in order, all seeded (`RNG`, `fbm2`, `hash2` — never `Math.random`):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph T["1 · Terrain"]
    R[relief] --> WA[water] --> PA[paths] --> ST[stairs] --> GR[ground] --> BO[border]
  end
  subgraph O["2 · Objects"]
    HW[hearthwick · goldenfield · mountLumen · oldQuarry · mirrormere · amberpine · meadowlands · emberwood] --> PE[people] --> EX[extras] --> SL[sightlines] --> SC[scatterTrees · scatterRocks] --> DH[dressHouses] --> CC[clearCrowns] --> RG[regions]

  OUT -- yes --> W[write public/levels/starfall-vale.json]
  OUT -- no --> X[exit 1, nothing written]
```

- **Terrain** — `relief()` (tiers with noisy edges pinned straight where falls and stairs sit),
  `water()`, `paths()` (43 polylines), `stairs()` (13 flights with landing pads), `ground()` (grass
  variety, farmland plots, hamlet decks, the observatory floor and broken walls, ruins, the void mine
  shaft, the glade's standing stones, quarry benches), `border()` (4 rows north, 3 elsewhere, 11
  deep-forest patches, no one-tile corridors between forest tiles).
- **Objects** — every placement goes through `add()`, which reserves the prop's approximate
  `PropFactory` colliders in a spatial hash; keep-clear zones protect door fronts, villagers, wells,
  campfires and bridge ends; the scatter follows `TREE_RULES` / `ROCK_RULES` per zone; `clearCrowns()`
  then drops the scattered trees whose crowns hide a sight target (8 in the current output).
- **Validation** — see the [level design guide §14](../LEVEL_DESIGN_GUIDE.md#14-validation). The
  current run reports: 156214 of 156468 standable quarter-unit nodes reachable (99.8 %), the island as
  the only unreachable pocket, all 20 routes within limits (e.g. spawn → square 58.5 u for 58.5 u
  straight; Hearthwick → observatory 31.0 for 28.2), 2.5 % of path tiles hidden behind roofs, and a
  green feature-coverage checklist.
- **Output** — `serializeLevel` of the normalised level; the run is byte-identical every time, and the
  editor saves it byte-identically too.

---

## How to modify it safely

1. **Edit the generator, not the JSON.** Change the area function (`hearthwick()`, `people()`, …),
   then run `node tools/make-starfall-vale.mjs`. If it refuses, read the ✗ lines; `--force` writes the
   failing level for inspection only.
2. **Expect the scatter to move.** Placements that draw a seed (`nextSeed()`: houses, trees, rocks,
   crate stacks, stalls) shift every seed after them, and any new collider or keep-clear zone changes
   what the tree and rock scatter may place. Re-check the busy places visually after a change.
3. **Add a route** to `ROUTES` for every new walk a sign or villager promises and for every new
   crossing — reachability alone misses closed alleys and removed bridges.
4. **New sight targets** (a landmark the camera must see) go into `sightlines()`.
5. **Keep coverage green**: the level must keep using every tile type, every non-combat object type
   (`coverage()` checks the `OBJECT_TYPES` entries without `combat: true`; the combat types —
   `enemy`, `chest`, `waystone` — are [Cinderwatch Pass](cinderwatch-pass.md)'s to cover), every
   action, behaviour, critter kind and non-weather particle preset, 24–30 villagers with 2–5 pages,
   text on every door, sign and well.
6. **Re-test in the game**: walk the King's Road from the spawn to the observatory, talk to the
   villagers you touched, check night lighting, and compare draw calls
   (`__game.state().drawCalls` ≤ ~300 at the default zoom). Test coordinates: spawn (70.5, 121.5);
   square (70, 57.5); Fallsview Bridge (58.5, 44.6) for the Sisters; observatory (74, 12.6); hamlet
   lane (91.6, 58.8) → (92.5, 64.5); Long Pier end (100.9, 66.5); Wishing Oak (58.2, 114.3); glade
   (19.5, 115.5).
7. **To continue by hand**, open it in the editor and **Save as** a new name — then that copy is an
   editor level and the generator no longer owns it. Never commit hand edits to `starfall-vale.json`.

## Known limits

- The world's densest views: fully zoomed out (distance 42) and turned, the square reaches ~300 draw
  calls; at the default distance every town view stays ≤ 283.
- In the busy square a few of the 20+ nearby lamps are unlit at any moment at night (12 pooled
  lights; the build report measured about 3.4 within 12 units, before the review's pool tuning) —
  by design.
- 1.8 % of walkable ground is unreachable in tiny (< 3 tile) patches the pocket rule allows; the only
  large pocket is the island.
- Dunstan mentions "glittery bits in the stone", but the quarry has dust, not sparkle. The review
  left it, reasoning that an emitter would shift the generator's seeds; in fact `emit()` draws no
  seed and reserves no collider, so a sparkle area in `oldQuarry()` would only renumber the later
  `emitter_N` ids.
- The festival items are inventory flavour only; the Starfall "event" is visual (no star falls).
