# Emberfall — Riverside Village

The design document of **Emberfall**, the demo level the game plays when no `?level=` is given: a
small, dense riverside village at golden hour with a windmill on the hill, a waterfall, a river and
bridge, a farm, an autumn grove with a pond and a campfire meadow — and eight villagers with
hand-written conversations. This page records its layout, landmarks with coordinates, people,
mechanics and settings, and how to change it without breaking the look it was tuned to.

## Concept and story

*"Our founders followed this river up from the lowlands four hundred years ago. At dusk the falls
catch the last of the sun and glow like embers in a hearth. Hence the name."* — Elder Maren

Emberfall is the engine's showcase **in miniature**: every feature within a minute's walk, framed
for the diorama camera. The player, a traveller, arrives in the village square at golden hour
(17:12). There is no quest; the village is a place to wander, talk, rest at the inn, take an
apple, hear the bard's song and watch the day turn — the scholar on Windmill Hill explains the
controls in character.

| Fact | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Size | 48 × 40 tiles, ringed by a 3-tile forest border (open only where the spring enters in the north and the river leaves in the south) |
| Objects | 136 (37 trees, 14 rocks, 8 benches, 8 fences, 8 villagers, 7 regions, 6 houses, 6 lampposts, 6 particle areas, 6 barrels …) |
| Walkable / water tiles | 1324 / 131 |
| Height levels | 0–11 (plain at level 2 = y 1.0; Windmill Hill level 8 = y 4.0; meadow level 1 = y 0.5) |
| Water | `waterLevel` 0.4, flow `[0, 0.45]` (south), `reflect 0.2`, `neutral 0.2` |
| Spawn | (19.5, 24.2) facing down — in the square, south of the well |
| Light sources | 12 — exactly the engine's 12 point lights, so each is permanent |

---

## Layout

North is up (the camera looks north). The village sits on a plain at level 2 between Windmill Hill
(north), the river (east of centre) and the Campfire Meadow, one level lower (south).

## Regions

Order matters (first match wins). All have the subtitle ("sub") *Emberfall*.

| # | Region | Rect (x, z) | `minY` | Banner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Windmill Hill | 0–48 × 0–11 | 3.2 | "Where the valley keeps its winds" |

## People

All eight villagers use hand-written scripts (`script` ids → `CONVERSATIONS` in
[`src/demo/dialogue.js`](../../../src/demo/dialogue.js)); their data `dialogue` is unused while the
script exists. These ids are part of the automation API (`window.__game.talkTo(id)`).

| Id | Name | Preset | Position | Behaviour | Action | What they do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `elder` | Elder Maren | elder | (18.3, 20.1) | wander 1.1 | — | Tells the founding story and recommends the inn; later visits alternate between the well / the hill and a short farewell. |
| `innkeeper` | Rosalind | innkeeper | (21.6, 17.1) | wander 0.7 | rest | "Will you rest until morning?" — **Not yet** / **Rest until morning**. Resting fades out, sets the clock to 8:00, plays a chime ("You feel well rested.") and she greets you in the morning. |
| `merchant` | Bertram | merchant | (22.2, 22.35) behind the stall | post, wander 0.35 | shop | Offers an apple "on the house" — **Just looking** / **Take an apple**; each apple adds to `inventory.apples` with a toast "Obtained: Crisp Apple ×n". `talkOffset [0, 2.7]`, `talkRadius 1.5`: you talk to him from in front of the counter. |
| `guard` | Corporal Hale | guard | (29, 23.55) at the bridge | post, wander 0.4 | — | "Halt! State your— ah." Guards the bridge, warns about the river after dark. |
| `farmer` | Old Tobin | farmer | (6.8, 26.3) in the fields | wander 2 | — | Talks to his turnips; the chickens have filed a complaint. |
| `child` | Pip | child | (6.2, 18.6) | chase in `area` −2.6…3.2 × −1.3…1.2 | — | Chases the chickens (they scatter from Pip and the player); alternates two lines ("I'm sneaking up on Duchess"). |
| `bard` | Wren | bard | (21, 32.5) at the campfire | perform | music | First talk: introduces his song *Emberfall Evening* and starts the music if it is off. Later, while it plays: **Keep playing** / **Rest a while** (stops it); when silent he plays again. `talkRadius 1.7`. |
| `scholar` | Ottoline Quill | scholar | (37.2, 6.4) on Windmill Hill | wander 1.6 | — | Explains T, R, P, Q / E, Z / X (or the wheel), the debug-panel key (Backquote, written `{~}` in her text) and H in character. |

**Critters:** 5 chickens in the barn yard (`chickens`, (6.5, 18.55), yard rect −3.1…3.1 × −1.35…1.35,
seed 4242); a cat round the square (`cat`, (14.4, 21.6), radius 3.2); 4 plaza birds with fixed start
spots that take flight when you come close (`birds`, (17.5, 24.8)).

![A conversation in Emberfall](../../assets/screenshots/emberfall-dialogue.jpg)

**Interactables:** all 6 house doors have knock text ("Knock"), the well ("Look", splash sound) and
4 signposts ("Read").

## How it was made

Emberfall started as hand-written JavaScript (`src/demo/maps/emberfall.js` plus `NPC_DEFS` /
`OBJECT_TEXT` in `dialogue.js` and `CAMERA_BOUNDS` in `config.js`), built and reviewed in phase 2 of
the project (57 review findings, 43 fixed — see [history](../../history/PROJECT_HISTORY.md)). When the
level editor arrived, **`tools/convert-emberfall.mjs` converted it once** into
`public/levels/emberfall.json`, with one binding requirement: *Emberfall must look and play exactly
as before*. The converter:

- transcribes what the old code built procedurally (windmill, spring cascade, particle areas,
  critters, god-ray areas, foliage zones, title camera);
- writes options the `PropFactory` picks at random when absent as `null` ("seeded random": house
  shutters, door hoods, woodpiles; tree and rock seeds), so the props come out identical;
- computes the random rotations of barrels, crates and crate stacks with the factory's own RNG.

The old module no longer exists; the JSON is the **single source of truth**.

---

## How to modify it safely

- **Edit in the editor** (`editor.html?open=emberfall`, Ctrl+S saves back to
  `public/levels/emberfall.json` under `npm run dev`) or edit the JSON by hand, one object per line.
  Saving it unchanged leaves `git diff` empty.
- **Never re-run `tools/convert-emberfall.mjs`.** It rebuilds the level from the pre-conversion code
  in git and would overwrite every later change. With its default `--rev=HEAD` it now stops with
  "The legacy Emberfall constants are gone from the working tree and could not be read from git
  revision "HEAD"" and writes nothing; only an old revision (e.g. `--rev=8e36884`, the phase-2
  commit) makes it run — and then it writes `public/levels/emberfall.json` unless `--out` says
  otherwise.
- **Keep it at ≤ 12 light sources.** With 12 descriptors every lantern owns a permanent light; a 13th
  switches the level to the pooled mode, where lights follow the camera — a visible change.
- **Keep the ids** `elder`, `innkeeper`, `merchant`, `guard`, `farmer`, `child`, `bard`, `scholar`
  and their `script` fields: tests and the README's automation hooks use them. The scripts mention
  Emberfall's places (the Ember & Oak, Windmill Hill, Duchess the hen); rename a place and update
  [`dialogue.js`](../../../src/demo/dialogue.js) too.
- **Emberfall is the regression baseline** for engine changes on small levels — the game loads it by
  default, and its draw calls, triangles and light list must stay identical unless a change is
  intended (see [TESTING_AND_VERIFICATION](../../development/TESTING_AND_VERIFICATION.md)).
- Follow the [level design guide](../LEVEL_DESIGN_GUIDE.md) for anything you add north of a house,
  near the river or on the hill.

## Known issues

- **Blind zones behind buildings.** At the default camera 94 of 987 standable points (1-unit grid)
  are hidden by buildings — worst behind the thatched cottage (the west road from the square to the
  farm, x 10.5–14.5, z 21.5–25.5, including the farm sign) and the Riverside house (the falls' west
  bank, x 25.5–28.5, z 11.5–14.5). The x-ray silhouette covers them; moving the houses would change
  the layout.
- In lantern-lit places night is still brighter than dusk (by design of the lamps; away from them
  dusk ≥ night).
- At the start position the thatched cottage in the lower-left foreground is blurred by the near
  depth of field — intentional Octopath-style framing that hides part of the farm from some angles.
- **Tobin's fenced field is sealed.** Its gate (the gap in the east fence at x 9.9, z 26.2–27.6)
  opens onto the thatched cottage's west wall, too close for the player to pass, so Old Tobin can
  only be talked to across the fence ([KNOWN_ISSUES LVL-20](../../ai/KNOWN_ISSUES.md#levels-and-generators);
  found by `npm run level:check -- emberfall`).
